The years seem to fly by as I'm sighing\nTime ticks on by never quite on my side; I wonder, am I a child or an old man dying? \nThese angels on my shoulders only serve to weigh me down\nOne day there wings might lift me, and then I'll hand over my crown\n\nI've got a bent reputation, and it's no speculation about these failed expectations that I'm meeting\nI've got a scarlet lover and an old grey haired mother; but the wolves and the crows are never fleeting\nThere's a burden on my back now, that pushes my face into the ground\nOne day I might break under it's weight, and then I'll hand over my crown"},
