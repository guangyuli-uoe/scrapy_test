done\n\nYo, 'sup!, I'm Gabbie, I'm a high roller\nRollin' through in a brand new Toyota Corolla\nLive alone in a two-bedroom apartment\nBut it's real cheap, you can tell by the carpet\nThat's ok, 'cause I'm never home\nI'm at the gym as you probably know\n'Cause I post about it every single time\nSo my weight loss never slips your mind\nI'm workin' out like eight days a week\n'Cause I can't control myself when I eat (I'm hungry)\nThink I'm an Insta model now, what's that about?\nBy the way, have I mentioned that I work out?\nHad the glow up of the motherfucking century\nBut I'll still die alone eventually\nThat's right I'm single and can't keep a man\n'Cause I'm crazy in a way you could never understand\nLots of fans, but where all my friends at?\nI'm alone every night of the weekend\n'Cause my social life's been in the trash can\nLove myself when I'm pumped with injections\nOh, uh, oh, oh, no, my views are low\nLooks like my hair has got to go again\nBut, hey, no sweat, no biggie\nAs long as you pay attention to me\nPay attention to me\nPay attention to me\n\nAlways say I'm working hard but then again, who am I kidding?\nSee my job is a joke, I take selfies for a living\nBut I gotta say, it's not no work, all play\nIf you're not convinced, check my resume\nCall myself a musician, but count my songs, 1, 2\nFirst single, 'Out Loud', sounds better on mute\nAnd speaking of single, it makes no sense man\n\"I'm a satellite\", but never had a true connection\nMy music's underwhelming but my biggest crimes\nAre my New York Times best selling nursery rhymes\n\nStorytime!\nI admit, I may have overreacted\nAnd I hope you can see past it if I'm over-dramatic\nIf my antics seem erratic and a touch problematic\nIt's an old habit\nI do mental acrobatics\nMake the situation seem undoubtedly traumatic\nWhen the the truth is if you study my intense reactions\nThen my actions are a far cry from pragmatic\nIt's a business tactic\n'Cause the honest fact is\nIf you break it down, it's really quite systematic\nSee I have audience that has a demographic\nOn a platform run by analytics\nOn a platform that's strictly algorithmic\nOn a platform as long as your charismatic\nThen the platform rewards bein' a dick\nSo maybe that's me (if the shoe fits, wear it)\nHey, forgive me\nLike the video and share it\nAnd I think that we all forgive Bryan Le\n'Cause he only did what you all wanna do to me\n\nOverwhelmed, overworked, overpaid\nI'm on top of the world, sittin' pretty on a stack\nBut the static still cracks in my veins\nAt the bottom of the universe, I'm feelin' all the weight\nPeople die for this\nPeople lie for this\nPeople suck and f*ck some guy for this\nPay the toll for this\nSell their soul for this\nPlay my part, but what's my role in this\nI'm not built for this\nAll the guilt in this\nAnd I don't think I can deal with this\nI'm too old for this\nGonna fold from this\nPeople starving and I get gold for this?\nYou all chaulk me up as some whiny f*ck\nWho's stressed my success like, \"my life sucks\"\nI get it, I know\nIt's such a conundrum\nI get what I want, but I can't have much fun with it\nIt's not the fame or the money I'm yearnin'\nI don't give a f*ck about what I've been earnin'\nBut each day I wake up more blessed that I'm learing\nOf all these people, I'm least to deserve it\nI don't deserve it\nI try to be perfect\nI'll never be perfect\nI'm not worth it\nKeep lookin' for answers, I swear that I'm searchin'\nBut I keep come up short, and I give up quick\n'Cause if I found it, I think I'd be scared of it\nYou don't see the scene that's behind the screen\nAnd I urge you all to be aware of it\nIt's an interesting dichotomy of monetized sincerity\nStir up my insecurity with constant uncertainty\nGeneration of anxiety\nThe, \"Look at me,\" society\nDubiety of piety\nThe gods all suffer silently\nI'm sorry for my obsession with attention\nI have ungodly fear of rejection\nMy apprehension and objection is the viral infection\nOf dollars and followers in place of affection\nWhat I need is a human connection\nNot blue light and a foggy reflection\nOf my misconception of my own perception\nResult of too much introspection\nThey find my disinterest interesting\nMy depression, a funny thing\nMy decline is relatable\nPeople love that I hate myself\nYeah, they love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\nPeople love that I hate myself\nI climbed out of my head\nAnd watched myself implode\nA thought without a body\nOught to be a shot to take a load\nOff my brain is poisoned\nAnd I'm searching for the antidote\nBut every time I find it\nMy defenses scream, \"Oh, no you don't!\"\nWoah\nBut it's fine\nNo, really I'm fine\nIt's just a matter of time\nYou'll lose your mind\nAnd not be fine from time to time\nI'm not crazy\nBut I feel crazy all a sudden\nIn a city never seein'\nSnow or rain or leaves in autumn\nLose yourself in seasons\nNot remembering that you forgot 'em\nKnocking on my door\nI can't confront 'em so I lock them out\nBut I don't mind\nNo, I really don't mind\n'Cause believe it or not\nIt feels good to be forgot from time to time\nSo forget me\nAnd please, God, forgive me\nIf you feel a touched underwhelmed\nBy all my overwhelming negativity\nWho am I and when?\nWhen's my work day end and where does me
